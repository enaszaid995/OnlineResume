         A web developer with a vast array of knowledge in many different front end and back end languages,
          responsive frameworks, databases, and best code practices.
          My objective is simply to be the best 
         web developer that I can be and to contribute to the technology industry all that I know and can do.
         While a student at University, I believe that my understanding of problem solving is also a skill
         that have and will continue to contribute to my overall success as a web developer.
